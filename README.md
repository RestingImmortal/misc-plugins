# misc-plugins
Various small, not very serious plugins not large enough to warrant its own repo.

### Items
Misc within the misc. More or less a place to flesh out various things before they are added elsewhere. The things can be accessed with [Ciu Kreo](https://github.com/RestingImmortal/Ciu-Kreo) or [Omnis](https://github.com/Darcman99/Omnis).


### Olden Things
Adds some ancient ES history to the current version of the game as well as makess some changes to the UI. The outfits and ships can be accessed with [Ciu Kreo](https://github.com/RestingImmortal/Ciu-Kreo) or Omnis, found within [Adde](https://github.com/Darcman99/Adde-Endless-Sky).

### Rainbow Pleiades
Turns the galaxy sprite for the pug empty galaxy into a rainbow.

### WWWS but Luna made this one
WWWS, but Luna did the work on this. Currently changes all ship, most effects, all human weapons, and all systems.
